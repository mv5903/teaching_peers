# teaching_peers
These are the programs/information that I use to teach my peers. More will be put up as soon as I can.
Use the [src](https://github.com/mv5903/teaching_peers/tree/master/src) file to view the code.

Additionally, tutorial files have been moved under teaching_peers to the [gettingIntoACPS](https://github.com/mv5903/teaching_peers/tree/master/src/gettingIntoAPCS) folder.

# I will put this in the readme (from StringClass.java)
See [here](https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~tomw/java/unicode.html) for a Unicode Chart.
Use the decimal values when referring to the order based upon unicode values.
