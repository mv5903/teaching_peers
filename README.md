# This Repository is Dedicated to Teaching my Peers Java in Preperation to Skip Intro To Computer Science and go Directly into APCSA, or For People who Want to Get Ahead While in Intro.

### teaching_peers
These are the programs/information that I use to teach my peers. More will be put up as soon as I can.
Use the [questions](https://github.com/mv5903/teaching_peers/tree/master/questions) folder to view the questions. The corresponding answers can be found in their respective [src](https://github.com/mv5903/teaching_peers/tree/master/src) folder.

Additionally, tutorial files have been moved under teaching_peers to the [gettingIntoACPS](https://github.com/mv5903/teaching_peers/tree/master/src/gettingIntoAPCS) folder.

#### I will put this in the readme (from StringClass.java)
See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) for a Unicode Chart.
Use the decimal values when referring to the order based upon unicode values.
